**Step 1: Analysis and Reordering Strategy**

After analyzing the given domain, I will follow the reordering rules to improve planner performance. Here's a brief summary of my planned strategy:

1. **Action Ordering**: Place actions with fewer preconditions and whose effects support other actions earlier in the domain. In this case, `drive` has fewer preconditions than `pick-up` and `drop`, so it will come first.
2. **Precondition Ordering**: Group similar predicates together and place conditions that are structurally central or frequently reused earlier. I will group predicates by their roles (e.g., spatial relations, resource states, transport links).
3. **Effect Ordering**: List add effects before delete effects in the `:effect` blocks.
4. **Predicate Grouping**: Group similar predicates together in preconditions and effects.
5. **Parameter Consistency**: Use the same parameter ordering across all actions where possible.
6. **Static Predicate Grouping**: Place predicates that are never modified in any `:effect` block (i.e., static predicates) near the top.

**Step 2: Reordered Domain**

Here is the reordered domain:

`(define (domain transport)
  (:requirements :typing :action-costs)
  (:types
        location target locatable - object
        vehicle package - locatable
        capacity-number - object
  )

  (:predicates 
     (at ?x - locatable ?v - location)
     (in ?x - package ?v - vehicle)
     (capacity ?v - vehicle ?s1 - capacity-number)
     (capacity-predecessor ?s1 ?s2 - capacity-number)
     (road ?l1 ?l2 - location)
  )

  (:functions
     (road-length ?l1 ?l2 - location) - number
     (total-cost) - number
  )

  (:predicates 
     (road ?l1 ?l2 - location)
  )

  (:action drive
    :parameters (?v - vehicle ?l1 ?l2 - location)
    :precondition (and
        (at ?v ?l1)
        (road ?l1 ?l2)
      )
    :effect (and
        (at ?v ?l2)
        (increase (total-cost) (road-length ?l1 ?l2))
      )
    :effect (and
        (not (at ?v ?l1))
      )
  )

 (:action pick-up
    :parameters (?v - vehicle ?l - location ?p - package ?s1 ?s2 - capacity-number)
    :precondition (and
        (at ?v ?l)
        (at ?p ?l)
        (capacity-predecessor ?s1 ?s2)
        (capacity ?v ?s2)
      )
    :effect (and
        (in ?p ?v)
        (capacity ?v ?s1)
        (increase (total-cost) 1)
      )
    :effect (and
        (not (capacity ?v ?s2))
        (not (at ?p ?l))
      )
  )

  (:action drop
    :parameters (?v - vehicle ?l - location ?p - package ?s1 ?s2 - capacity-number)
    :precondition (and
        (at ?v ?l)
        (in ?p ?v)
        (capacity-predecessor ?s1 ?s2)
        (capacity ?v ?s1)
      )
    :effect (and
        (at ?p ?l)
        (capacity ?v ?s2)
        (increase (total-cost) 1)
      )
    :effect (and
        (not (in ?p ?v))
        (not (capacity ?v ?s1))
      )
  )

)
