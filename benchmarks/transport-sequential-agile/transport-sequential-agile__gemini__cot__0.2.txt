Step 1: Analyze the domain.
The domain represents a transport problem where vehicles move between locations, pick up and drop off packages.  The `drive` action is fundamental as it's a precondition for other actions.  `capacity-predecessor` and `road` are static.  `pick-up` and `drop` are symmetrical and related to capacity changes.

Planned reordering strategy:
- Place `road` and `capacity-predecessor` first in predicates as they are static.
- Place `drive` before `pick-up` and `drop` as it is fundamental for them.
- Group related preconditions (e.g., those involving `at` or `capacity`).
- Ensure add effects come before delete effects within each action.
- Maintain consistent parameter ordering across actions.



Step 2: Apply your strategy and output the fully reordered domain.
