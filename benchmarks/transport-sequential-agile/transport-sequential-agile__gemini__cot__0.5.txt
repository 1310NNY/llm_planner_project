Step 1: Analyze the domain.
The domain represents a transport problem where vehicles move between locations, pick up and drop off packages.  The `drive` action is fundamental, enabling other actions. `road` and `capacity-predecessor` are static. Preconditions and effects can be grouped by predicate and object relevance. Parameter ordering can be standardized. Add effects should precede delete effects.

Step 2: Apply your strategy and output the fully reordered domain.
