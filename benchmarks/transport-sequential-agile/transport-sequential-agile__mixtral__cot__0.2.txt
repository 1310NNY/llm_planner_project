Step 1: Analysis and Strategy

1. Action ordering: The `drive` action should be placed earlier since it has fewer preconditions and is more likely to be used earlier in plans.
2. Precondition ordering: In `:precondition` blocks, I will prioritize the predicates based on their potential importance: `(at)`, `(road)`, `(in)`, `(capacity)`, and `(capacity-predecessor)`.
3. Effect ordering: I will ensure add effects are listed before delete effects in `:effect` blocks.
4. Predicate grouping: I will group similar predicates together in preconditions and effects, especially those with the same name or referring to the same objects or resources.
5. Parameter consistency: I will use the same parameter ordering across all actions where possible.
6. Static predicate grouping: I will place predicates that are never modified in any `:effect` block (i.e., static predicates) near the top.
