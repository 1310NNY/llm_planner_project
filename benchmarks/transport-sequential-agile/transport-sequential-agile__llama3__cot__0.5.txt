**Step 1: Analyze the domain.**

The domain `transport` has 4 actions (`drive`, `pick-up`, `drop`, and none other) and 5 predicates are defined in the `:predicates` section. There are 2 static predicates (`road ?l1 ?l2 - location` and `capacity-predecessor ?s1 ?s2 - capacity-number`) and 3 dynamic predicates (`at ?x - locatable ?v - location`, `in ?x - package ?v - vehicle`, `capacity ?v - vehicle ?s1 - capacity-number`). 

**Step 2: Reorder the domain elements to improve planner performance.**

Based on the analysis, here is the planned reordering strategy:

1. **Static predicate grouping**: Move static predicates to the top of the `:predicates` section.
2. **Parameter consistency**: Use the same parameter ordering across all actions where possible.
3. **Action ordering**: Place actions earlier in the domain if they are likely to be used earlier in plans. Estimate this based on structural cues: actions with fewer preconditions, or those whose effects support other actions, should appear early in the domain.
4. **Effect ordering**: In `:effect` blocks, list add effects before delete effects (i.e., `(not ...)`).
5. **Predicate grouping**: Group similar predicates together in preconditions and effects (e.g., those with the same name or referring to the same objects or resources).
6. **Precondition ordering**: In `:precondition` blocks, place conditions that are structurally central or frequently reused earlier.

Here is the reordered domain:
