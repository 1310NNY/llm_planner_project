Step 1: Analysis and Strategy

1. Action ordering: The `drive` action should be placed earlier since it has fewer preconditions and is more likely to be used earlier in plans.
2. Precondition ordering: In `:precondition` blocks, I will prioritize spatial relations and object states.
3. Effect ordering: I will ensure add effects are listed before delete effects.
4. Predicate grouping: I will group similar predicates together in preconditions and effects.
5. Parameter consistency: I will use the same parameter ordering across all actions where possible.
6. Static predicate grouping: I will place static predicates near the top in the `:predicates` section.

Step 2: Reordered Domain
