Step 1: Analysis and Strategy

1. Action ordering: The `drive` action should appear before `pick-up` and `drop` actions since it does not have any preconditions on packages or vehicle capacities.
2. Precondition ordering: In the `pick-up` and `drop` actions, place the conditions related to the vehicle's location, the package's location, and the package-vehicle relation earlier. The capacity-related conditions should be placed last.
3. Effect ordering: Ensure add effects are listed before delete effects in `pick-up` and `drop` actions.
4. Predicate grouping: Group capacity-related predicates together in `pick-up` and `drop` actions.
5. Parameter consistency: Use the same parameter ordering across all actions.
6. Static predicate grouping: Place the `road` predicate near the top since it is never modified in any effect block.

Step 2: Reordered Domain
