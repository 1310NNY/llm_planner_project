Step 1: Analyze the domain.
The domain describes a transport problem where vehicles move between locations, pick up and drop packages.  The `drive` action enables movement, and `pick-up` and `drop` handle package loading and unloading, respectively.  `capacity` and `capacity-predecessor` predicates manage vehicle capacity. The reordering strategy will prioritize commonly used predicates and actions, place add effects before delete effects, and group related predicates together.  Static predicates like `road` and `capacity-predecessor` will be placed at the beginning of the `:predicates` section.


Step 2: Apply your strategy and output the fully reordered domain.
