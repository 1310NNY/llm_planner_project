**Step 1: Analyze the domain and summarize the reordering strategy**

The given domain is for a transportation problem where vehicles can move between locations, pick up and drop packages, and have limited capacity. The domain has 4 actions: `drive`, `pick-up`, `drop`, and 1 function: `total-cost`.

Based on the reordering rules, here's a brief summary of the planned strategy:

1. Action ordering: Place actions with fewer preconditions and those whose effects support other actions earlier.
2. Precondition ordering: Prioritize conditions that are structurally central or frequently reused, such as spatial relations and resource states.
3. Effect ordering: List add effects before delete effects.
4. Predicate grouping: Group similar predicates together, such as those with the same name or referring to the same objects or resources.
5. Parameter consistency: Use the same parameter ordering across all actions where possible.
6. Static predicate grouping: Place static predicates near the top.

**Step 2: Apply the strategy and output the fully reordered domain**

Here's the reordered domain:

`(define (domain transport)
  (:requirements :typing :action-costs)
  (:types
        location target locatable - object
        vehicle package - locatable
        capacity-number - object
  )

  (:predicates

     (in ?x - package ?v - vehicle)
     (capacity ?v - vehicle ?s1 - capacity-number)
     (capacity-predecessor ?s1 ?s2 - capacity-number)
     (road ?l1 ?l2 - location)
  )

  (:functions
     (road-length ?l1 ?l2 - location) - number
     (total-cost) - number

  (:action drive
    :parameters (?v - vehicle ?l1 ?l2 - location)
    :precondition (and

    :effect (and

        (not (at ?v ?l1))
      )
  )

 (:action pick-up
    :parameters (?v - vehicle ?l - location ?p - package ?s1 ?s2 - capacity-number)
    :precondition (and

    :effect (and

        (capacity ?v ?s1)
        (not (capacity ?v ?s2))
        (increase (total-cost) 1)
        (not (at ?p ?l))
      )
  )

  (:action drop
    :parameters (?v - vehicle ?l - location ?p - package ?s1 ?s2 - capacity-number)
    :precondition (and
        (at ?v ?l)
        (in ?p ?v)
        (capacity-predecessor ?s1 ?s2)
        (capacity ?v ?s1)
      )
    :effect (and
        (at ?p ?l)
        (capacity ?v ?s2)
        (not (capacity ?v ?s1))
        (increase (total-cost) 1)
        (not (in ?p ?v))
      )
  )
