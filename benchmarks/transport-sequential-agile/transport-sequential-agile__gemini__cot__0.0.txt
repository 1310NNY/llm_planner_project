Step 1: Analyze the domain.

The `drive` action has fewer preconditions and enables the other actions by moving the vehicle. It should come first. `pick-up` and `drop` are related and should be kept together.  Within actions, predicates related to location and capacity should be grouped and ordered for consistency. Add effects should be listed before delete effects.  `(road ?l1 ?l2)` and `(capacity-predecessor ?s1 ?s2)` are static and should appear early in the predicates list.


Step 2: Apply your strategy and output the fully reordered domain.
