**Step 1: Analyze the domain**

After analyzing the domain, I have identified the following elements:

1.  **Actions:** There are 20 actions in total, each with its own set of preconditions and effects.
2.  **Predicates:** There are 17 predicates in total, which are used to define the preconditions and effects of the actions.
3.  **Types:** There are 4 types in total, which are used to define the structure of the predicates.

**Reordering Strategy:**

To reorder the domain elements, I will follow the strategy outlined in the problem statement. The strategy involves the following steps:

1.  **Action Ordering:** Place actions earlier in the domain if they are likely to be used earlier in plans.
2.  **Precondition Ordering:** In `:precondition` blocks, place conditions that are structurally central or frequently reused earlier.
3.  **Effect Ordering:** In `:effect` blocks, list add effects before delete effects (i.e., `(not ...)`).
4.  **Predicate Grouping:** Group similar predicates together in preconditions and effects.
5.  **Parameter Consistency:** Use the same parameter ordering across all actions where possible.
6.  **Static Predicate Grouping:** In the `:predicates` section, place predicates that are never modified in any `:effect` block (i.e., static predicates) near the top.

**Step 2: Apply the strategy and output the fully reordered domain**

Here is the fully reordered domain:
