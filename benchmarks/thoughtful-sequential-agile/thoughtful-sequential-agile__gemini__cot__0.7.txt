Step 1: Analyze the domain.
The domain represents a simplified version of Klondike solitaire. Actions involve moving cards between columns, the talon, and home cells. Key predicates relate to card positions (on, clear, bottomcol, bottomtalon, toptalon, ontalon), card properties (ace, king, suit, value), game state (colspace, talonplayable, instack, home, faceup), and card stacking rules (canstack, successor, colsuccessor).  Static predicates are successor and colsuccessor.

The reordering strategy will focus on:
- Prioritizing actions that enable other actions, such as those freeing up cards or creating empty columns.
- Ordering preconditions to check frequent conditions like faceup and clear status first.
- Grouping related actions (talon-related, column-related, home-related) for better locality.
- Ensuring add effects precede delete effects in all action definitions.
- Placing static predicates at the beginning of the :predicates section.

Step 2: Apply your strategy and output the fully reordered domain.
