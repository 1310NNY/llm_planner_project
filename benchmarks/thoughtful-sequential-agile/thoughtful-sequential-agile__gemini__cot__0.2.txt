Step 1: Analyze the domain.
The domain represents a simplified version of Klondike Solitaire.  The reordering strategy will focus on placing actions related to moving cards to the home cells earlier, as this is the primary objective of the game.  Actions dealing with talon manipulation and inter-column moves will be placed later. Within actions, preconditions will be ordered based on card relationships (e.g., `on`, `clear`) followed by card properties (e.g., `suit`, `value`), and finally talon and column status. Effects will have add effects before delete effects. Predicates will be grouped by their function (game objective related, card state, column/talon state). Static predicates (`suit`, `value`, `successor`, `canstack`, `colsuccessor`, `ace`, `king`) will be placed at the beginning of the `:predicates` section.

Step 2: Apply your strategy and output the fully reordered domain.
