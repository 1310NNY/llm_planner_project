Step 1: Analyze the domain.

The domain represents a simplified version of Klondike solitaire. Actions involve moving cards between columns, the talon, and home cells.  The reordering strategy will focus on grouping related actions (talon, column, home) and ordering them from simple (fewer preconditions) to complex. Within actions, preconditions and effects will be ordered for better matching, with add effects before delete effects. Static predicates will be placed at the top.  Parameter ordering will be standardized where possible.

Step 2: Apply your strategy and output the fully reordered domain.
