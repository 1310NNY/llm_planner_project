Step 1: Analyzing the domain and planned reordering strategy

After analyzing the domain, I have identified the following reordering strategy:

1. Action ordering: I will order actions based on their structural complexity, placing actions with fewer preconditions earlier in the domain. I will also consider the order of actions in terms of the problem-solving process, such as moving cards between columns, then moving cards from columns to homes.

2. Precondition ordering: I will order preconditions based on their importance and structural centrality. For example, I will place conditions related to the cards being moved earlier in the precondition list.

3. Effect ordering: I will follow the rule of listing add effects before delete effects (i.e., `(not ...)`).

4. Predicate grouping: I will group similar predicates together in preconditions and effects, especially those with the same name or referring to the same objects or resources.

5. Parameter consistency: I will maintain the same parameter ordering across all actions where possible.

6. Static predicate grouping: I will place predicates that are never modified in any `:effect` block (i.e., static predicates) near the top.

Step 2: Applying the strategy and outputting the reordered domain
