Step 1: Analyzing the domain and strategy

The domain consists of actions for moving cards between columns, from column to home, from talon to column, from talon to home, turning the deck, and preconditions for each action. The strategy for reordering elements to improve planner performance includes:

1. Grouping similar predicates together in preconditions and effects.
2. Placing actions earlier in the domain if they are likely to be used earlier in plans, such as actions with fewer preconditions or those whose effects support other actions.
3. In `:precondition` and `:effect` blocks, placing conditions that are structurally central or frequently reused earlier.
4. Listing add effects before delete effects (i.e., `(not ...)`) in `:effect` blocks.
5. Using the same parameter ordering across all actions where possible.
6. Placing predicates that are never modified in any `:effect` block (i.e., static predicates) near the top in the `:predicates` section.

Step 2: Applying the strategy and outputting the reordered domain
