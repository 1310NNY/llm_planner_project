Predicates: Identify static predicates (never appearing in any effect) and move them to the top of the `:predicates` list. Group related predicates (e.g. spatial relations, talon relations, column relations, home relations) together.\n\n2. Actions:  \n   a. Order actions by increasing structural complexity (fewer preconditions first) and by their likely use early in a plan (e.g. “turn-deck” before “tal-to-col” before moves to home/column).  \n   b. Within each action:  \n      - Keep parameter ordering consistent (e.g. card, supporting card, destination card or numeric/column parameters in the same order everywhere).  \n      - In `:precondition`, list more central predicates (e.g. location relations like `on`, `ontalon`) before resource or type checks.  \n      - In `:effect`, list all positive (add) effects first, grouped by type, then all delete effects (`(not ...)`), also grouped.\n\n3. Precondition/effect grouping: Group similar predicates (e.g. all `ontalon` together, all `colspace`/`colsuccessor` together).\n\nThis reordering should improve planner indexing and heuristic computation.', type='output_text')], role='assistant', status='completed', type='message')]
