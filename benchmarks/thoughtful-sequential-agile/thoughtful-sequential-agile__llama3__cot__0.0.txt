Step 1: Analyze the domain.

The domain consists of 24 actions, 19 predicates, and 5 types. The actions can be categorized into three main groups: moving cards between columns, moving cards from the talon to columns or home, and turning the deck. The predicates can be grouped into three categories: predicates related to card properties (e.g., `ace`, `king`, `clear`, `faceup`), predicates related to card positions (e.g., `on`, `ontalon`, `home`), and predicates related to card values and suits (e.g., `suit`, `value`, `successor`).

Based on the structural cues and the frequency of use of these predicates, the following reordering strategy will be applied:

1. Place actions earlier in the domain if they are likely to be used earlier in plans. This means placing actions with fewer preconditions or those whose effects support other actions earlier in the domain.
2. In `:precondition` blocks, place conditions that are structurally central or frequently reused earlier. This means placing predicates related to card properties and positions earlier in the preconditions.
3. In `:effect` blocks, list add effects before delete effects (i.e., `(not ...)`).
4. Group similar predicates together in preconditions and effects.
5. Use the same parameter ordering across all actions where possible.
6. Place predicates that are never modified in any `:effect` block (i.e., static predicates) near the top.

Step 2: Apply the strategy and output the fully reordered domain.

Here is the reordered domain:
