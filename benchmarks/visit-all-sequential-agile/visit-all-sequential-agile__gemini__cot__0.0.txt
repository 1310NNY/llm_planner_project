Step 1: Analyze the domain.
The domain describes a robot navigating a grid.  The key action is `move`. The predicates `connected` is static, `at-robot` describes the robot's location, and `visited` tracks visited locations. The reordering will focus on placing the static predicate first, ordering effects (add before delete), and ensuring parameter consistency.


Step 2: Apply your strategy and output the fully reordered domain.
(define (domain grid-visit-all)
(:requirements :typing)
(:types place - object)
(:predicates (connected ?x ?y - place)
             (at-robot ?x - place)
             (visited ?x - place))
(:action move
:parameters (?curpos ?nextpos - place)
:precondition (and (connected ?curpos ?nextpos) (at-robot ?curpos))
:effect (and (at-robot ?nextpos) (visited ?nextpos) (not (at-robot ?curpos))))
)
