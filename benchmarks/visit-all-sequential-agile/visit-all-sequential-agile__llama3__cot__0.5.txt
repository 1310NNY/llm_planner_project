**Step 1: Analyze the domain and summarize the reordering strategy.**

The given domain consists of 4 elements: 1 type, 3 predicates, and 1 action. The action has 2 preconditions and 3 effects. 

To reorder the domain according to the given rules, my strategy is:

1. **Action ordering**: The action should be placed at the beginning of the domain because it's the only action defined.
2. **Predicate grouping**: The predicates can be grouped by their roles (e.g., spatial relations, resource states).
3. **Static predicate grouping**: The static predicates (those that are never modified in any effect block) should be placed near the top in the predicates section.
4. **Parameter consistency**: The parameter ordering should be maintained across all actions.
5. **Effect ordering**: The add effects should be placed before the delete effects in the effect block of the action.
6. **Precondition ordering**: The preconditions that are structurally central or frequently reused should be placed earlier.

**Step 2: Apply the strategy and output the reordered domain.**

Here is the reordered domain:

(define (domain grid-visit-all)
(:requirements :typing)
(:types        place - object)
(:predicates (at-robot ?x - place)
	     (visited ?x - place)
	     (connected ?x ?y - place)
)
(:action move
:parameters (?curpos ?nextpos - place)
:precondition (and (at-robot ?curpos) (connected ?curpos ?nextpos))
:effect (and (at-robot ?nextpos) (visited ?nextpos) (not (at-robot ?curpos)))
)

)
