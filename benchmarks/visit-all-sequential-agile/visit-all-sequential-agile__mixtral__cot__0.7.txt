Step 1: Analysis and Strategy

The domain is about a robot visiting all places in a grid. The main action is moving from one place to another.

1. Action ordering: `move` action should be placed early since it's the only action and will be used throughout the plan.
2. Precondition ordering: The `at-robot` and `connected` predicates are essential for the `move` action, so they should be placed earlier in the `:precondition`.
3. Effect ordering: The `:effect` is already ordered correctly with adds before deletes.
4. Predicate grouping: Similar predicates are already grouped in the `:predicates` section.
5. Parameter consistency: The parameter ordering is consistent across all actions.
6. Static predicate grouping: There are no static predicates in this domain.

Step 2: Reordered Domain

(define (domain grid-visit-all)
(:requirements :typing)
(:types place - object)
(:predicates (at-robot ?x - place)
	     (connected ?x ?y - place)
	     (visited ?x - place)
)
(:action move
:parameters (?curpos ?nextpos - place)
:precondition (and (connected ?curpos ?nextpos) (at-robot ?curpos))
:effect (and (at-robot ?nextpos) (not (at-robot ?curpos)) (visited ?nextpos))
)
)
