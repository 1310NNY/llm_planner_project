Step 1: Analysis and Strategy

The domain is about a robot visiting all places in a grid. The action move lets the robot move from one connected place to another, marking it as visited.

My strategy is as follows:

1. Action ordering: No need to reorder actions since there's only one action move.
2. Precondition ordering: Keep the existing order since it has only one precondition.
3. Effect ordering: Change the order of effects in move to have add effects before delete effects.
4. Predicate grouping: Group similar predicates in preconditions and effects.
5. Parameter consistency: Maintain the existing order of parameters.
6. Static predicate grouping: Since no predicates are never modified, this rule does not apply.

Step 2: Reordered Domain

(define (domain grid-visit-all)
(:requirements :typing)
(:types place - object)
(:predicates (at-robot ?x - place)
	     (visited ?x - place)
	     (connected ?x ?y - place)
)

(:action move
:parameters (?curpos ?nextpos - place)
:precondition (and (at-robot ?curpos) (connected ?curpos ?nextpos))
:effect (and (not (at-robot ?curpos)) (at-robot ?nextpos) (visited ?nextpos))
)

)
