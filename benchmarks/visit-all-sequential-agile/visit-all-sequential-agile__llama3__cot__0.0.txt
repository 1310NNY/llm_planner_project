**Step 1: Analyze the domain and summarize the reordering strategy**

The given domain is for a grid-visit-all problem. The main actions are moving a robot from one place to another. The domain has three predicates: `connected`, `at-robot`, and `visited`. 

Based on the reordering rules, here's a brief summary of the planned strategy:

1. Action ordering: Move action should appear early in the domain since it's likely to be used in plans.
2. Precondition ordering: `at-robot` and `connected` predicates should be placed early in preconditions as they are structurally central and frequently reused.
3. Effect ordering: Add effects should be listed before delete effects.
4. Predicate grouping: Group similar predicates together (e.g., `at-robot` and `visited`).
5. Parameter consistency: Use the same parameter ordering across all actions.
6. Static predicate grouping: Place `connected` near the top as it's a static predicate.

**Step 2: Apply the strategy and output the fully reordered domain**

```pddl
(define (domain grid-visit-all)
(:requirements :typing)
(:types        place - object)
(:predicates (connected ?x ?y - place)
	     (at-robot ?x - place)
	     (visited ?x - place)
)
(:action move
:parameters (?curpos ?nextpos - place)
:precondition (and (at-robot ?curpos) (connected ?curpos ?nextpos))
:effect (and (at-robot ?nextpos) (visited ?nextpos) (not (at-robot ?curpos)))
)

)
```
