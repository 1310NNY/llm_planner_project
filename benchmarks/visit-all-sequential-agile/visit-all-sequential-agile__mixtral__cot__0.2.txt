Step 1: Analysis and Strategy

The domain is about a robot visiting all places in a grid. The action move lets the robot move from one connected place to another, marking it as visited.

My strategy is to:
1. Move the action move closer to the beginning of the domain since it is the only action and will be used in every plan.
2. Place the at-robot precondition first in the move action since it is structurally central and frequently reused.
3. Follow the effect ordering rule by listing add effects before delete effects.
4. Group similar predicates together in preconditions and effects.
5. Maintain parameter consistency by using the same parameter ordering across all actions.
6. Place static predicates (those never modified in any effect block) near the top of the domain.

Step 2: Reordered Domain

(define (domain grid-visit-all)
(:requirements :typing)
(:types place - object)

(:predicates
	(connected ?x ?y - place) ; grouping similar predicates
	(at-robot ?x - place)
	(visited ?x - place)
)

(:action move
:parameters (?curpos ?nextpos - place)
:precondition (and (at-robot ?curpos) ; placing structurally central precondition first
		   (connected ?curpos ?nextpos))
:effect (and (not (at-robot ?curpos)) ; effect ordering: add effect first
	     (at-robot ?nextpos)
	     (visited ?nextpos))
)

)
