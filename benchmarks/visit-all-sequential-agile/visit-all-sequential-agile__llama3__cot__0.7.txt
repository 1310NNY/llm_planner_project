Step 1: Analyze the domain and planned reordering strategy briefly.

The domain involves a robot visiting all places in a grid, represented by `place` objects. The main actions are moving from one place to another and marking a place as visited. There are three predicates: `connected`, `at-robot`, and `visited`.

The planned reordering strategy is:

1. Action ordering: Move the action `move` earlier in the domain since it is likely to be used early in plans and has fewer preconditions compared to other actions.
2. Precondition ordering: No preconditions are defined for the `move` action, so this step can be skipped.
3. Effect ordering: In the `:effect` block, list add effects before delete effects.
4. Predicate grouping: Group similar predicates together (e.g., `at-robot` and `visited`, which both relate to the robot's state).
5. Parameter consistency: Use the same parameter ordering across all actions where possible (in this case, `?curpos` and `?nextpos` are already consistent).
6. Static predicate grouping: The `connected` predicate is never modified in any `:effect` block, so it should be placed near the top.

Step 2: Apply the strategy and output the fully reordered domain.
