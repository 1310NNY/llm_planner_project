Step 1: Analyze the domain.
The domain `grid-visit-all` describes a robot navigating a grid. The robot can move between connected places. The goal (implicit, defined in problem files) is likely to visit all places.  The `connected` predicate is static as it represents the grid structure and never changes. The reordering strategy will focus on bringing the `connected` predicate to the top, ordering the `move` action's effects (add before delete), and maintaining parameter consistency which is already present.

Step 2: Apply your strategy and output the fully reordered domain.
(define (domain grid-visit-all)
(:requirements :typing)
(:types place - object)
(:predicates (connected ?x ?y - place)
             (at-robot ?x - place)
             (visited ?x - place))
(:action move
:parameters (?curpos ?nextpos - place)
:precondition (and (connected ?curpos ?nextpos) (at-robot ?curpos))
:effect (and (at-robot ?nextpos) (visited ?nextpos) (not (at-robot ?curpos))))
)
