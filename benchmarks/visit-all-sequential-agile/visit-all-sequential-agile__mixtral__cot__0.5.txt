Step 1: Analysis and Strategy

The domain is about a robot visiting all places in a grid. The action move lets the robot move from one connected place to another, marking it as visited.

My strategy is to:
1. Move action move up to be the first action since it is the only action and is likely to be used earlier in the plan.
2. Place the at-robot precondition first in move's precondition list since it is a structural prerequisite for the action.
3. Follow the effect ordering rule by listing add effects before delete effects in move's effect block.
4. Group similar predicates in move's precondition and effect blocks.
5. Place the visited predicate last in move's effect block since it is the only effect that is never modified.
6. Place the connected and visited predicates at the top in the predicates section since they are never modified.

Step 2: Reordered Domain

(define (domain grid-visit-all)
(:requirements :typing)
(:types place - object)
(:predicates
	(connected ?x - place)
	(visited ?x - place)
	(at-robot ?x - place)
)

(:action move
:parameters (?curpos ?nextpos - place)
:precondition (and (at-robot ?curpos) (connected ?curpos ?nextpos))
:effect (and (not (at-robot ?curpos)) (at-robot ?nextpos) (visited ?nextpos))
)

)
