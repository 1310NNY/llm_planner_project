**Step 1: Analyze the domain and summarize the planned reordering strategy**

Based on the given domain, here's a summary of the planned reordering strategy:

1. **Action ordering**: The `move` action will remain as it is, since it's the only action in the domain.
2. **Precondition ordering**: The precondition `(at-robot ?curpos)` is likely to be used earlier in plans, so it will be placed first. The second precondition `(connected ?curpos ?nextpos)` will be placed next.
3. **Effect ordering**: The add effect `(at-robot ?nextpos)` will be placed before the delete effect `(not (at-robot ?curpos))`. The add effect `(visited ?nextpos)` will be placed last.
4. **Predicate grouping**: The predicates will be grouped by their names, with `at-robot` and `visited` being grouped together.
5. **Parameter consistency**: The parameter ordering will be kept consistent across the `move` action.
6. **Static predicate grouping**: The predicates will be grouped by their static nature, with `connected` being placed last since it's the only dynamic predicate.

**Step 2: Apply the strategy and output the fully reordered domain**

Here's the reordered domain:

`(define (domain grid-visit-all)
(:requirements :typing)
(:types        place - object)
(:predicates (at-robot ?x - place)
	     (visited ?x - place)
	     (connected ?x ?y - place)
)
	
(:action move
:parameters (?curpos ?nextpos - place)
:precondition (and (at-robot ?curpos) (connected ?curpos ?nextpos))
:effect (and (at-robot ?nextpos) (visited ?nextpos) (not (at-robot ?curpos)))
)

)`
