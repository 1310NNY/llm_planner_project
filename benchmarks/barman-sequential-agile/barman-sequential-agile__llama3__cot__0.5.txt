**Step 1: Analyze the domain and summarize the planned reordering strategy**

The given domain is for a barman, involving various actions related to preparing and serving cocktails. The domain consists of 11 actions and 11 predicates. Here's a brief summary of the planned reordering strategy:

1. **Action ordering**: Actions with fewer preconditions or whose effects support other actions will be placed earlier in the domain.
2. **Precondition ordering**: Conditions that are structurally central or frequently reused will be placed earlier in preconditions.
3. **Effect ordering**: Add effects will be listed before delete effects.
4. **Predicate grouping**: Similar predicates will be grouped together in preconditions and effects.
5. **Parameter consistency**: The same parameter ordering will be used across all actions where possible.
6. **Static predicate grouping**: Static predicates will be placed near the top in the `:predicates` section.

**Step 2: Apply the strategy and output the fully reordered domain**
