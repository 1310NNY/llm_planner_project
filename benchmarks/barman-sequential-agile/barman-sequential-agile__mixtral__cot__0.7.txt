Step 1: Analyze the domain and summarize the planned reordering strategy

1. Action ordering: The `grasp` and `leave` actions should be placed early as they are likely to be used often. Actions that modify the level of the shaker, such as `pour-shot-to-clean-shaker`, `pour-shot-to-used-shaker`, and `empty-shaker`, should also be placed early due to their structural importance.

2. Precondition ordering: Preconditions involving the `handempty` and `holding` predicates are frequently used. They should be placed earlier in the preconditions blocks.

3. Effect ordering: Ensure add effects are listed before delete effects in `:effect` blocks.

4. Predicate grouping: Group similar predicates together in preconditions and effects. For instance, `(holding ?h1 ?s)` and `(contains ?s ?i)` are used in multiple preconditions and effects, so they should be grouped together.

5. Parameter consistency: Maintain consistent parameter ordering (e.g., `?h1 ?h2 - hand`, `?s - shot`, `?i - ingredient`, `?d - dispenser`, etc.).

6. Static predicate grouping: Place predicates that are never modified in any `:effect` block near the top of the `:predicates` section.

Step 2: Apply the strategy and output the reordered domain
