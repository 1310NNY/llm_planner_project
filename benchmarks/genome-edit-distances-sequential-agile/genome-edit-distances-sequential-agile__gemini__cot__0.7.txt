Step 1: Analyze the domain.
The domain models genome editing operations.  Actions represent steps within multi-step procedures (cutting, splicing, inverse splicing).  Reordering will focus on:
- Placing static predicates first.
- Ordering actions to reflect typical operation sequences (cut -> splice/inverse splice -> reset).
- Grouping preconditions and effects by predicate and consistent parameter order.
- Ensuring add effects precede delete effects within `:effect` blocks.


Step 2: Apply your strategy and output the fully reordered domain.
