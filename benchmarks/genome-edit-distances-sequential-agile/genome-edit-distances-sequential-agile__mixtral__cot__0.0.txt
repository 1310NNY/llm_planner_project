Step 1: Analyzing the domain and planned reordering strategy

After analyzing the given PDDL domain, I have identified the following reordering strategy based on the provided rules:

1. Action ordering: I will order actions based on their structural complexity, placing actions with fewer preconditions earlier. I will also consider the order of actions in action sequences like cutting, splicing, and inverse splicing.
2. Precondition ordering: I will order predicates in preconditions based on their structural centrality and frequency of use. For example, predicates related to genome representation like `cw`, `free`, `gone`, `present`, `normal`, and `inverted` will be placed earlier.
3. Effect ordering: I will ensure that add effects are listed before delete effects (i.e., `(not ...)`).
4. Predicate grouping: I will group similar predicates together in preconditions and effects, especially those with the same name or referring to the same objects or resources.
5. Parameter consistency: I will maintain the same parameter ordering across all actions where possible.
6. Static predicate grouping: I will place predicates that are never modified in any `:effect` block (i.e., static predicates) near the top.

Step 2: Applying the strategy and outputting the reordered domain
