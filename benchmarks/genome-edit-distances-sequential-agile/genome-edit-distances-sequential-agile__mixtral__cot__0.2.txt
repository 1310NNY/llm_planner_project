Step 1: Analyzing the domain, I will follow these strategies:

1. Actions will be grouped by their functionality (cutting, splicing, inverse splicing) and ordered based on the number of preconditions and effects. Actions with fewer preconditions and effects are likely to be used earlier in plans.
2. Predicates will be grouped by their role in the problem domain, such as genome representation, operation sequencing, or auxiliary predicates.
3. Preconditions and effects will have conditions that are structurally central or frequently reused placed earlier.
4. Parameter ordering will be consistent across all actions where possible.

Step 2: Here is the fully reordered domain:
