Step 1: Analyze the domain.

The domain models genome editing operations. Actions represent steps within larger operations like cutting, splicing, and inverting. The domain uses control flow predicates to sequence these steps. Static predicates, like `duplicate` and `swappable`, are unused in this version.  The reordering strategy will focus on:

- Moving static predicates to the top.
- Ordering actions within each operation to match their typical execution sequence.
- Placing add effects before delete effects within each action.
- Grouping related predicates within preconditions and effects.
- Using consistent parameter ordering.



Step 2: Apply your strategy and output the fully reordered domain.
