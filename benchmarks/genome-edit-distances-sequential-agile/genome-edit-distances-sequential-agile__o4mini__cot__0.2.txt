predicates first, then dynamic ones, grouping similar predicates together.\n- Actions: order by expected use and number of preconditions—simple single‐gene inverts first, then cutting sequence, then splicing, then inverse‐splicing, finishing with reset.\n- In each action, put the control/state precondition first, then spatial/resource relations; in effects list all add effects (including numeric increases) before delete effects; group related effects.\n\n```lisp\n(define (domain genome-edit-distance)\n  (:requirements :equality :action-costs)\n  (:predicates\n    (duplicate ?x ?y)\n
