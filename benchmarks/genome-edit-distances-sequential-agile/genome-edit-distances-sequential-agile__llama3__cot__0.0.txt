Step 1: Analyze the domain.

The given domain is a genome-edit-distance domain with ITT operations only. It consists of 24 actions, 19 predicates, and 2 functions. The domain includes actions for cutting, splicing, and inverse splicing, as well as special actions for inverting a single gene and resetting the last-cut-point.

Based on the reordering rules, here is a brief summary of the planned reordering strategy:

1. Action ordering: Place actions earlier in the domain if they are likely to be used earlier in plans. This can be estimated based on structural cues, such as actions with fewer preconditions or those whose effects support other actions.
2. Precondition ordering: In `:precondition` blocks, place conditions that are structurally central or frequently reused earlier. This can be estimated based on predicate roles, such as spatial relations, resource states, or transport links.
3. Effect ordering: In `:effect` blocks, list add effects before delete effects (i.e., `(not ...)`).
4. Predicate grouping: Group similar predicates together in preconditions and effects (e.g., those with the same name or referring to the same objects or resources).
5. Parameter consistency: Use the same parameter ordering across all actions where possible.
6. Static predicate grouping: In the `:predicates` section, place predicates that are never modified in any `:effect` block (i.e., static predicates) near the top.

Step 2: Apply the strategy and output the fully reordered domain.

Here is the reordered domain:
