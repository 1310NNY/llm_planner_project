Step 1: Analyze the domain.

Based on the given domain, I will summarize my planned reordering strategy:

1. **Action ordering**: 
   - Place actions with fewer preconditions earlier in the domain.
   - Place actions whose effects support other actions earlier in the domain.

2. **Precondition ordering**: 
   - Place conditions that are structurally central or frequently reused earlier in the preconditions.

3. **Effect ordering**: 
   - List add effects before delete effects in the effects.

4. **Predicate grouping**: 
   - Group similar predicates together in preconditions and effects.

5. **Parameter consistency**: 
   - Use the same parameter ordering across all actions where possible.

6. **Static predicate grouping**: 
   - Place predicates that are never modified in any effect block near the top.

Step 2: Apply the strategy and output the fully reordered domain.
